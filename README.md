The focus of this project is to develop a model focusing on the logitudinal dynamics of the vehicle. 
It takes into consideration the driver behaviour, environmental conditions such as the temperature and grade to model the energy, power and torque requirements of the vehicle.

For this project DC Machine is considered for traction.
